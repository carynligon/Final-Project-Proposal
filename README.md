- elevator pitch:
  - My app will be a mixology search-based application where users can learn to make particular cocktails or be recommended one based on the outputted data of a Traitify personality assessment.


- basic features:
  - Search Feature: This feature will begin by the user narrowing their search down to a specific spirit. Then, they will be able to filter results by tasting notes, skill level, ingredients, etc. Results will be able to be browsed as soon as they specify spirit, unless they select a 'view all' option
  - Surprise Me Feature: This feature will prompt the user to take a 2-3 minute Traitify assessment to determine their core personality traits. Based on the outcome of the assessment, they will randomly be given a cocktail that matched their data (based on tagged traits given to each cocktail).
  - Cocktail of the week: This will just be a randomly chosen cocktail that will change every 7th day of the month.
  - User Profiles: Each user will have a "made log" where they can keep track of cocktail recipes they've tried and include notes (and maybe images)
  - Appendix: Much like a "docs" section. The appendix will breakdown terminology used in recipes to make them very easy for anyone to make - recipes will have links to parts of this appendix when necessary
